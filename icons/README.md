# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the following icon files for the ProtonPay Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels) 
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editing software or online icon generators. The icons should represent a lightning bolt or wallet theme to match the ProtonPay extension's purpose.

For now, you can use placeholder icons or create simple ones with a lightning bolt symbol (âš¡) on a colored background.
